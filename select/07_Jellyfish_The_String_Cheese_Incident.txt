Chorus:
My brain is just a jellyfish in the ocean of my head
Cause I drank too much tequila and I woke up seein red
Now all I really want from life is to crawl back into bed
On account that my brain is just a jellyfish in the ocean of my head

Well I woke up this mornin and the phone was ringing
My boss was talking just kept on squawkin like a vacuum cleaner
Like a barking dog like a headache screamin through my mental fog
So I pulled on my pants and headed towards the door
But the room began to spin and I fell to the floor
Almost made it to work but stopped along the way
Two girls said 'hey wanna come with us to Santa Fe?'
I said Id love to but you see Ive got to get to my job
Thats when they knocked me out and threw me in the back of their Saab

Well I work up somewhere around Pagosa Springs
Both of them lookin at me and gigglin and whisperin things
We arrived at their house a big adobe palace
I gave a lecherous look to the girl named Alice

I could tell right away that they both were willin
But the next thing that happened wasnt quite so thrillin
They said first youve got to come up and meet Marys mom
But it wasnt a mom more like an atom bomb hit and this came Out from where the earth was split Rollin pin in hand Gestapo Patch on arm she was mean and she was bound to do me some harm
So I run down the steps in the front of the house
Back to the highway I scurried like a mouse
Take off my backpack pull out some rum
Take a big long swig and sick out my thumb

Chorus

I arrived at work early the next morning they said 'Where you been? Cause the boss has been roaring.'
I said never mind that, listen what I say, If you drink too much tequila
Stay at home the next day. And dont mess with women from Santa Fe.
